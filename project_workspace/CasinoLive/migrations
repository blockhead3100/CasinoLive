The migrations directory is typically used to store migration scripts generated by Flask-Migrate or Alembic. Since you requested the contents of the migrations directory and it is usually populated with migration scripts, I will provide a comment indicating that this directory is intentionally left blank.

# migrations
# This directory is intentionally left blank. Migration scripts will be generated here by Flask-Migrate.
